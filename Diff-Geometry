How to solve dT / dl = F(l) where T and F are tensors.? 

This differential equation is essentially an initial value problem for a tensor-valued function of a scalar variable. The equation

				𝑑𝑇 / 𝑑𝑙 = 𝐹(𝑙)

states that the rate of change of the tensor 𝑇(l) with respect to the scalar parameter l is given by another tensor F(l). 
In many applications—ranging from continuum mechanics to differential geometry— T and F might represent, for example, stress tensors, metric tensors, or other geometric objects. 
The key to solving the equation is to use integration in a manner that is analogous to solving a scalar ordinary differential equation, but applied component-wise.
Below is a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem.

1. Understanding the Tensor Equation
Component Interpretation
Assume that T(l) and F(l) are tensors whose components depend on the parameter l. In a coordinate system, if T(l) has components 

$$\frac{dT}{dl} = F(l)$$
