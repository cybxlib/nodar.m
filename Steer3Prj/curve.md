## Two-dimensional space--------------------------------------------

"I have an equation da/dl = f(l) on a plane, where 'a' is the rotation angle of the curve, and 'l' is the distance traveled.
a = integral of f(l) * dl.
For example, if f(l) = 2.0 * R, the curve will be a circle with radius R.
And if f(l) = 0, it will be a straight line, regardless of the coordinate system.
All curves are one-dimensional, regardless of the coordinate system.
How would the equation look if 'da' is not in a plane but in three-dimensional space? The curve is still one-dimensional."

Explanation (Thinking about rotation in 3D):

"In the two-dimensional case, the rotation of the tangent is described by a single curvature function:

dl/da = f(l)
where a(l) is the angle between the tangent and a fixed axis, and
f(l) corresponds to the curvature.
When f(l) = 0, you get a straight line,
and with a constant f(l), you get a circle (with appropriate scaling).

## Three-dimensional space--------------------------------------------

In three-dimensional space, one function is not enough to describe a curve, as in addition to curvature, the concept of torsion appears, reflecting how the osculating plane (defined by the tangent and normal) rotates around the tangent. The classical description here is the Frenet-Serret system of equations:

dT/dl = κ(l)N
(the change of the unit tangent vector T is determined by the curvature κ(l) and the unit normal vector N)

dN/dl = -κ(l)T + τ(l)B
(the change of the normal depends on the curvature and torsion τ(l); B is the binormal vector)

dB/dl = -τ(l)N
(the binormal rotates around the normal with a torsion coefficient)

Where:

κ(l) = ||dT/dl|| is the curvature, τ(l) is the torsion.

Thus, instead of a simple scalar equation for the angle in 2D, in 3D space, the curve's behavior is defined by two functions κ(l) and τ(l).
If you wanted to write an analog of the equation for the vector rotation angle (which now has a direction in space), then its derivative with respect to arc length would be related to the angular velocity vector ω(l), which has components in both the normal and binormal directions:

dθ/dl = ω(l)

where the magnitude

||ω(l)|| = κ(l), and the direction is determined by the torsion τ(l) (i.e., how the orientation of the osculating plane changes).

Therefore, in three-dimensional space, the description of a one-dimensional curve requires considering not only the change in the tangent rotation angle, but also the change in the orientation of the osculating plane, which leads to the Frenet-Serret system of equations."

---Explanation:-----------------------------------

frenet_serret(l_values, curvature_func, torsion_func):

This function takes arc length values (l_values) and functions for curvature (curvature_func) and torsion (torsion_func) as input.
It initializes the tangent (T), normal (N), and binormal (B) vectors, as well as the initial position (P).
It iterates through the arc length values, calculating the changes in the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors using the Frenet-Serret formulas.
It updates the position based on the tangent vector.
It returns the x, y, and z coordinates of the curve.
Example Usage (if __name__ == "__main__":)

It creates an array of arc length values using np.linspace().
It defines example curvature and torsion functions (in this case, for a helix). You can change these functions to create different curves.
It calls the frenet_serret() function to calculate the curve's coordinates.
It uses matplotlib to plot the 3D curve.
It then shows examples of a circle, and a straight line in 3d space.
